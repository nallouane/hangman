# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

This project is implemented by using a while loop to first get a valid input letter. This input is then checked against
a word to see if the letter is contained in the word.
