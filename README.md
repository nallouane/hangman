## Project Description

Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word, and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This project is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word, and the user tries to guess it.

The Hangman game implementation involves using a while loop to first get a valid input letter. This input is then checked against a word to see if the letter is contained in the word.
