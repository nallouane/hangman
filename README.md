## Project Description

Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word, and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This project is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word, and the user tries to guess it.

## Usage

Instructions on how to play the Hangman game...
The game will guide you to input a single alphabetical letter. Upon doing so, it will verify whether the guessed letter is part of the target word. If correct, you will receive information about the position of the letter within the word, along with the number of letters remaining. In case of an incorrect guess, you will lose a life, and the game will notify you of the remaining lives. In my game the player starts with 5 lives, best of luck!
